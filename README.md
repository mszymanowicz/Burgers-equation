# Burgers-equation
Numerical methods applied to fluid dynamics - short project, Matlab 2018b

In this project, Burgers' equation (written at the start of 'Raport.pdf') is solved numerically using slightly modified MacCormack method. It is esentially a predictor-corrector method. The corrector step is a backward finite difference approximation. **The purpose of this project is to create an .avi animation of numerical approximation of the fluid movement**. Framerate and other initial settings are fully definable by the user.

The project was reviewed by the university professor and got the highest possible mark, but there is still a lot of room for further improvement.
