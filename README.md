# Burgers-equation
Numerical methods applied to fluid dynamics - short project

In this project, Burgers' equation (written at the start of .pdf file) is solved numerically using slightly modified MacCormack method. It is esentially a predictor-corrector method. The corrector step is a backward finite difference approximation. **The purpose of this project is to create an .avi animation of numerical approximation of the fluid movement**. Framerate and other initial settings are fully definable by the user.
